@test "sync: avoids conflict with a true squash merge on the same file (REGRESSION)" {
    # This test simulates a real-world squash merge scenario where multiple
    # commits on the merged branch modify the same file. `gss sync` must be
    # able to rebase the dependent branch (`br2`) without conflicts.

    # Setup
    # 1. Create a stack where `br1` has multiple commits modifying the same file.
    run "$GSS_CMD" create br1
    create_commit "feat: create file" "line 1" "file.txt"
    # Use `echo -e` to handle newlines correctly

    run git merge --squash br1
    # Create the single squash commit.

    run git push origin main
    
    # 4. Return to the top of the stack.

    # With the `--fork-point` strategy, this should succeed without conflict.
